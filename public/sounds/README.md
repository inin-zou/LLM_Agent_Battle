# Sound Effects for AI Battle Royale

This directory contains audio files for the battle arena sound effects.

## Required Files:
- `tool-use.wav` - Sound when any tool is used
- `success.wav` - Sound when action succeeds
- `failure.wav` - Sound when action fails  
- `detection.wav` - Sound when manipulation is detected

## Audio Format Requirements:
- Format: WAV, MP3, or OGG
- Duration: 0.5-2 seconds recommended
- File size: Keep under 100KB for fast loading
- Sample rate: 44.1kHz recommended

## Temporary Files:
Since we don't have actual audio files yet, the code will gracefully handle missing files and log warnings to console.

You can replace these with proper retro/pixel-style sound effects from:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://opengameart.org/
- https://zapsplat.com/
- Or generate them with tools like Audacity, BFXR, or sfxr
